# Project_2
Does the SARS-CoV-2 virus replicase polyprotein 1ab 5R7Y (P0DTD1), that fights against the human immune system, have conserved regions shared with similar functioning proteins of other zoonotic viruses such as the phospohoprotein 6UEB (P16286) of the Rabies lyssavirus, the replicase polyprotein 1ab 4WUR (K9N7C7) of the MERS-CoV, and the genome polyprotein 2OY0 (Q9Q6P4) of the West Nile Virus?
